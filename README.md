# SlimSecure Developer Guide
Welcome to SlimSecure, the cutting-edge PHP API framework engineered by Engineer Kenneth Usiobaifo. Designed to enhance PHP integration within a slim API environment, SlimSecure stands out with its minimalistic design, robust security features, and exceptional performance. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to effectively utilize SlimSecure for developing efficient and secure web applications.

## Installation

Before you can start using SlimSecure, ensure you have PHP installed on your machine. You can either use XAMPP as your local server environment or utilize the built-in development server provided by SlimSecure.

# Getting Started
## Creating Project Components
SlimSecure simplifies the development process by providing a command-line interface (CLI) to quickly create various components of your application:

* Controllers:
    - Create a new controller using the command:
    ```
    ./slim create:controller controllerName
    ```
    This will generate a controller file in the designated controllers directory with basic setup code.

* Models:
    - To create a new model, use:
    ```
    ./slim create:model modelName
    ```
    This command creates a model file which you can use to define data interactions.

* Migrations:
    - Set up database migrations with:
    ```
    ./slim create:migration migrationName
    ```
    Migrations are crucial for managing database schema changes over time.
* Middleware:
    - Generate new middleware by running:
    ```
    ./slim create:middleware middlewareName
    ```
    Middleware allows you to manage HTTP requests and responses more effectively.

* Core Classes:
    - For additional core functionality, use:
    ```
    ./slim create:core coreName
    ```
    This will create a new core class file in your application’s core directory.

* Create new route:
    - For createing routes in SlimSecure, open the route.php file located in the route folder and add new route according to your requirement

## Running the Development Server
SlimSecure comes with a built-in development server which can be started using the CLI:
```
./slim -S <ip>:<port>
```
You can also specify the directory that the server should serve files from using the ``-t flag``:

```
./slim -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
```
This is useful if you want to mimic the structure of a production environment where public assets are stored in a ``public`` directory.
